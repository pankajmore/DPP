PROBLEM STATEMENT
This task is about the scoring in the first phase of the die-game Yahtzee, where five dice are used. The score is determined by the values on the upward die faces after a roll. The player gets to choose a value, and all dice that show the chosen value are considered active. The score is simply the sum of values on active dice.

Say, for instance, that a player ends up with the die faces showing 2, 2, 3, 5 and 4. Choosing the value two makes the dice showing 2 active and yields a score of 2 + 2 = 4, while choosing 5 makes the one die showing 5 active, yielding a score of 5.

Your method will take as input a vector <int> toss, where each element represents the upward face of a die, and return the maximum possible score with these values.



DEFINITION
Class:YahtzeeScore
Method:maxPoints
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int maxPoints(vector <int> toss)


CONSTRAINTS
-toss will contain exactly 5 elements.
-Each element of toss will be between 1 and 6, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{ 2, 2, 3, 5, 4 }

Returns: 5

The example from the text.

1)
{ 6, 4, 1, 1, 3 }

Returns: 6

Selecting 1 as active yields 1 + 1 = 2, selecting 3 yields 3, selecting 4 yields 4 and selecting 6 yields 6, which is the maximum number of points.

2)
{ 5, 3, 5, 3, 3 }

Returns: 10
