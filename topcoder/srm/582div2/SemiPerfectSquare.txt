PROBLEM STATEMENT
Magical Girl Iris loves perfect squares.
A positive integer n is a perfect square if and only if there is a positive integer b >= 1 such that b*b = n.
For example, 1 (=1*1), 16 (=4*4), and 169 (=13*13) are perfect squares, while 2, 54, and 48 are not.

Iris also likes semi-squares.
A positive integer n is called a semi-square if and only if there are positive integers a >= 1 and b > 1 such that a < b and a*b*b = n.
For example, 81 (=1*9*9) and 48 (=3*4*4) are semi-squares, while 24, 63, and 125 are not.
(Note that we require that a < b.
Even though 24 can be written as 6*2*2, that does not make it a semi-square.)

You are given a int N.
Return "Yes" (quotes for clarity) if N is a semi-square number.
Otherwise, return "No".

DEFINITION
Class:SemiPerfectSquare
Method:check
Parameters:int
Returns:string
Method signature:string check(int N)


NOTES
-The return value is case-sensitive. Make sure that you return the exact strings "Yes" and "No".


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 2 and 1000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
48

Returns: "Yes"

48 can be expressed as 3 * 4 * 4. Therefore, 48 is a semi-square.

1)
1000

Returns: "No"

1000 can be represented as 10 * 10 * 10, but it doesn't match the definition of semi-perfect squares.

2)
25

Returns: "Yes"



3)
47

Returns: "No"



4)
847

Returns: "Yes"
