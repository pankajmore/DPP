PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel is the owner of a ski resort. The ski resort has N places numbered 0 through N-1. You are given a vector <int> altitude. For each i, the i-th element of altitude is the altitude of the place i.


The skiers would like to follow the path (place 0) -> (place 1) -> ... -> (place N-1). The trip will only be possible if the altitudes of the places are non-increasing. In order to make the trip possible, Ciel now needs to decrease the altitudes of some places. In other words, Ciel wants to decrease some of the altitudes so that altitude[0] >= altitude[1] >= ... >= altitude[N-1] holds. It costs 1 unit of money to decrease the altitude of one place by 1 unit of height.


Return the minimal cost required for the change.

DEFINITION
Class:SkiResortsEasy
Method:minCost
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int minCost(vector <int> altitude)


CONSTRAINTS
-altitude will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of altitude will be between 0 and 1,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{30, 20, 20, 10}

Returns: 0

The altitudes are already non-increasing, so Ciel doesn't need to change anything.

1)
{5, 7, 3}

Returns: 2

Ciel should change the altitude of place 1 (0-based index) from 7 to 5.
This changes the sequence of altitudes to {5, 5, 3}.
The cost of the change is 7 - 5 = 2 units of money.

2)
{6, 8, 5, 4, 7, 4, 2, 3, 1}

Returns: 6

Ciel should change the altitudes to {6, 6, 5, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1}.

3)
{749, 560, 921, 166, 757, 818, 228, 584, 366, 88}

Returns: 2284



4)
{712, 745, 230, 200, 648, 440, 115, 913, 627, 621, 186, 222, 741, 954, 581, 193, 266, 320, 798, 745}

Returns: 6393
