PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are to create a class Multiples with a method number, which takes three ints: min, max, and factor.



Given a range of integers from min to max (inclusive), determine how many numbers within that range are evenly divisible by factor.


DEFINITION
Class:Multiples
Method:number
Parameters:int, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int number(int min, int max, int factor)


NOTES
-If x is evenly divisble by y, there exists some integer k such that k * y = x.


CONSTRAINTS
-min will be between -1000000 and 1000000, inclusive.
-max will be between -1000000 and 1000000, inclusive.
-max will be greater than or equal to min.
-factor will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
0
14
5

Returns: 3

The numbers 0, 5, and 10 are evenly divisible by 5, so this returns 3.

1)
7
24
3

Returns: 6

The numbers 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 are evenly divisible by 3, so this returns 6.


2)
-123456
654321
997

Returns: 780

3)
-75312
407891
14

Returns: 34515
