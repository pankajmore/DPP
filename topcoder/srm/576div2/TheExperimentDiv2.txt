PROBLEM STATEMENT
Manao is conducting an experiment to measure the humidity level of some spongy material. The experiment is conducted in a closed room which is observed from a side, so we will consider it in two dimensions.

The room is N centimeters wide. There are N drop counters built in the ceiling of the room. Drop counter 0 is attached 0.5 centimeters from the left end of the room, and each next one is attached 1 centimeter to the right of the previous one. The i-th (0-based index) drop counter drips intensity[i] drops per minute.

There are also M sponges in the room. The i-th (0-based) sponge is horizontally attached (i+1) centimeters below the ceiling and its left end is leftEnd[i] centimeters apart from the left wall of the room. All sponges are exactly L centimeters long and their thickness is negligible. Each sponge will totally absorb every drop that drips at it.



You are given a vector <int> intensity containing exactly N elements, a vector <int> leftEnd containing exactly M elements and a int L. You have to model the experiment that Manao is conducting to compute the amount of drops that each sponge will absorb per minute. Return a vector <int> of length M, where i-th element will be the number of drops absorbed by the i-th sponge.

DEFINITION
Class:TheExperimentDiv2
Method:determineHumidity
Parameters:vector <int>, int, vector <int>
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> determineHumidity(vector <int> intensity, int L, vector <int> leftEnd)


CONSTRAINTS
-intensity will contain N elements, where N is between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-Each element of intensity will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
-L will be between 1 and N, inclusive.
-leftEnd will contain M elements, where M is between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-Each element of leftEnd will be between 0 and N - L, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{3, 4, 1, 1, 5, 6}
3
{3, 1, 0}

Returns: {12, 5, 3 }

This is the example shown in the problem statement. The drops from counters 3, 4, 5 are absorbed by sponge 0, the drops from counters 1 and 2 are absorbed by sponge 1 and the drops from counter 0 are absorbed by sponge 2.

1)
{5, 5}
2
{0, 0}

Returns: {10, 0 }

There are two sponges, one right below another. The first sponge absorbs all drops and the second receives none.

2)
{92, 11, 1000, 14, 3}
2
{0, 3}

Returns: {103, 17 }

Note that some drops may fall down on the floor.

3)
{2, 6, 15, 10, 8, 11, 99, 2, 4, 4, 4, 13}
4
{1, 7, 4, 5, 8, 0}

Returns: {39, 14, 110, 0, 13, 2 }
